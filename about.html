                    <p>Hi there, my name is Nur Insyirah Husna binti Zulkifli, and I'm now studying Islamic Banking at UiTM Kota Bharu in Kelantan. My academic background represents my desire to learn about and make a contribution to the subject. I was passionate about discovering new experiences and opportunities that would enhance her personal and professional development, even outside of his academic pursuits. Furthermore, I proactively search for diverse endeavours that not only extend her perspectives but also boost her earnings, demonstrating her proactive attitude towards education and personal growth. Along with his academic endeavours, I saw to it that she worked part-time at Baskin Robbins on the weekends and in her spare time, demonstrating her excellent time management skills and strong work ethic. My active participation in the professional and academic spheres is a reflection of her desire to succeed and leave a lasting impact on the Islamic finance sector and beyond.</p>
